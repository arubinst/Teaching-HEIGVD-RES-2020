Students are encourage to make contributions to this repo:

## Weekly notes taken by students 

Here is a suggestion for organizing the notes that you take during the course and that you want to share with others. We can create one directory per week, and then one directory per contributing student. 

```
/student-notes/week-01
  /firstName1.lastName1
    /notes.md
  /firstName2.lastName2
    /notes.md
```
